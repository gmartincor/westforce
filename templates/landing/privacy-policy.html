                        At WestForce Removals, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This policy outlines how we handle the personal data we collect through our website, email communications, and service bookings in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).

                        When you contact us, request a quote, or use our moving services, we collect information such as your name, phone number, email address, pickup and delivery locations, and any details you provide about your move. We may also collect payment details and notes necessary for invoicing, insurance, or service improvement.

Your data is stored securely and used solely for these operational purposes. We never sell or share your personal information with third parties unless it is required by law or necessary for service delivery â€” for example, sharing limited details with an accountant or insurer under confidentiality obligations.
