                        Welcome to WestForce Removals. By using our website, requesting a quote, or booking our services, you agree to the following terms and conditions, which are governed by the laws of Western Australia.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        WestForce Removals provides professional furniture removal, relocation, and transport services throughout Perth and surrounding areas. All prices and quotes are listed in Australian dollars (AUD) and are based on the information you provide at the time of booking. Changes in load size, property access, or time requirements may affect final pricing. Additional fees may apply for stairs, long walking distances, parking restrictions, or unexpected delays.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Bookings are confirmed once we receive your acceptance by phone, email, or message. If you need to cancel or reschedule, we kindly ask for at least 24 hours' notice. Late cancellations may incur a call-out charge to cover allocated time and resources.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Clients are responsible for ensuring that access to both pickup and delivery addresses is safe and that all items are packed appropriately for transport if they did not select our professional packing service. Fragile, high-value, or bulky items should be clearly identified prior to loading. Our team takes every reasonable precaution to ensure your belongings are handled with care, using safe manual-handling techniques, protective equipment, and professional loading methods to minimise the risk of damage.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        All services are provided under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). In the rare event of damage or service faults, customers are entitled to repair, replacement, or refund as required by law. Liability is limited to the value of the affected goods or the cost of re-service, whichever is less. Optional transit insurance can be arranged upon request prior to the move.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Payment is due upon completion of the job unless otherwise agreed. We accept bank transfer, cash, or approved electronic payment methods. All invoices and receipts include our registered ABN: 83 541 053 716.

                        We operate under the Work Health and Safety Act 2020 (WA) and follow applicable Codes of Practice for fatigue management, manual handling, and workplace safety. Unsafe environments, access issues, or hazardous items may require rescheduling or refusal of service to ensure the safety of all parties.
